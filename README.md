# Jacobian Analysis of a Parameter Aware Reservoir Computing ML Algorithim

This repository contains the code and supplementary material for my **Master’s thesis**, where I explore a **parameter-aware reservoir computing (RC)** algorithm to learn and mimic the bifurcation behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems across varying parameter regimes.

📄 The full thesis document is available in this repository for detailed explanation, theoretical background, and results.

## 🧪 Overview

In this work, I developed a custom **Parameter-Aware Reservoir Computing (PARASPY)** framework that learns to **predict the future behavior** of different nonlinear systems **across parameter values**—not just at fixed settings.

### Key contributions:

* ✅ Implemented **reservoir computing from scratch** with parameter-awareness built into the architecture.
* ✅ Applied the framework to classic nonlinear systems:

  * **Logistic Map**
  * **Kuramoto Oscillators**
  * **Stuart-Landau Oscillators**
* ✅ Modeled the trained reservoir system as a **network of coupled map equations** to extract its internal dynamics.
* ✅ Performed **Jacobian analysis** on the reservoir network to study how its **eigenvalue spectra evolve with parameters**.
* ✅ Showed that the trained reservoir system undergoes **bifurcations** similar to the original dynamical system:

  * Saddle-node bifurcation
  * Neimark–Sacker bifurcation
  * Period-doubling bifurcation

This suggests that the **reservoir model internalizes the bifurcation structure** of the system it's trained on — a striking result connecting machine learning with nonlinear dynamics.

## ⚠️ Note on Code Availability

While this repository shows how to use the two main frameworks developed:

- 🧠 PARASPY (Parameter-Aware Reservoir Computing)

- 📈 Eigenvalue Analysis & Jacobian Framework

…the core implementation code of these frameworks is not included due to sharing restrictions.

🔎 However, their usage and behavior are clearly demonstrated in the included notebooks, and all results can be understood in context via the thesis.

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
